## Fuzzing

### Note

The sole purpose of this repository is to help me organize recent academic papers related to *fuzzing*, *binary analysis*, *IoT security*, and *general exploitation*. This is a non-exhausting list, even though I'll try to keep it updated...
Feel free to suggest decent papers via a PR.
