Okay guys, we are getting close to the time for the next panel. Head
back to your seats. You may bring food in with you. We also started 15
minutes late. People have 15 minutes .. we ended lunch on time. One of
our speakers literally only came for 30 minutes today, 2 to 230.

It's going to be escape. I don't know how to use Macs. It will be
minimize and then just go to panels and it will be the seventy first in
there. I think the livestream is not filming that though. Do you want to
do it before we announce it? Did we find her? Yeah, we found her. Okay,
that's fine. Oh, we have water for them. Nice. Talking to Constance
then. Let's do one more run.

Hello everybody. We are going to get the next panel started focusing on
Bitcoin regulation. Christian focuses on equity crowdfunding and the MIT
Bitcoin project. If you would like to submit a specific question, tweet
it @ccatalini. We are going to hand it off now.

Christian: I would like to welcome the panel. This will be difficult
because we are after lunch. Talking about regulation at MIT, a place
known for building things and breaking things, will be challenging but
we have some great help. We have Constance on my left, she has a JD. She
was the general council and CCO for Kraken. She is a digital currency
expert and has founded data. Next is Elizabeth, a graduate from Harvard
at Coin Center which we will hear more about in a second. Last and not
least we have Jerry, an adjunct professor of law, also the executive
director of Coin Center, an institution trying to bridge the gap between
research, academics, practicioners and policymakers. This panel will be
about policy.

Christian: I want to start with a controversial ... ((Sorry,
interrupted))

Christian: We should try to avoid market failure. We should avoid
destruction of public goods. As we move into other forms of intellectual
property, we really need to rethink how we deal with regulation and how
we go about the process of regulation today. On that positive note, I
would like to open it up to our panel to hear if you had a blank slate,
knowing what you know about this space and the dynamics of intellectual
property and regulation and policymakers, how would you go about
reinventing the debate for the modern era?

Jerry: If I had a blank slate and if I could do anything, so much of the
problem with regulation is path dependency. Okay, now it's on. So the
question is, if I had a blank slate, so nothing there, and a magic wand,
those pieces are important. The blank slate is important because so many
issues with regulation today that makes regulation inefficient is path
dependency and bureaucracy that makes it difficult to change. What I
would do is think about the purpose of regulation and then see if
technology allows us to achieve that purpose without a prescriptive
approach. Money transmission regulation which each of the states does
for itself is a type of regulation that effects Bitcoin business. If you
want to start an exchange, or hold custody, you need to have a money
transmission license. Ultimately it is an information asymmetry problem.
The regulators are trying to address this with regulation. If you are a
low income person with a checking account and you get paid, let's say
you cash your check, you need to pay your electric bill. But they don't
take cash. Okay, you get a money order from the money order company. You
buy a money order, you send it to your electric company. When they go to
cash it, it bounces. Why? Well the company went out of business. They
didn't have enough reserves. You didn't know that going in. But the
regulator sees this as an information asymmetry problem. So they think
they will license the business and require that they have a bond and see
on a regular basis when they audit them once a year that they are
solvent. But the technology now allows us to see transparently on a
minute by minute basis whether the company is solvent. So therefore you
don't need the regulation as it once was. I think we would look at the
regulation and then determine whether we need permissioning from the
government.

Elizabeth: I think that regulation is a boring word. To me this is much
more of a question of the feature viability of the ecosystem. As Jerry
stated, this is about what the technology is capable of doing. And how
it can serve a community and consumers. Our current regime is built for
an analog age. We didn't have cryptography. The early internet has been
instrumental in a lot of my work. We are lucky particularly to counter
the statement about AT&T. Telecom was substantially different from the
development of the internet. Arguably the internet has become more
centralized but maybe the blockchain technology can take us back. Early
internet had safe harbors. They were laws that enabled or often promoted
uses that say comply with the law but did not hold intermediaries
liable. So if I am youtube.com or facebook.com and someone posted an
infringing image, I could still operate that platform as long as I
comply with those laws. Ultimately anyone could startup a new site, an
open source project, a business, and they don't have to ask permission
from the government. Well, in money transmission you must ask
permission. So we have seen relatively little innovation. Our current
regime is flawed in the idea that once must ask for permission.
Blockchain solutions, multisig, real-time continuous auditing will
promote to regulators as the way forward as opposed to the idea... by
the way, $5k per startups per 50 states, and all the legal fees
involved, is a lot of money for a startup that only has $100k and a few
coders working in a basement. We need to reshape the conversation
regarding what's possible and what the community can build.

Constance: The internet offers us a lot of really great lessons on how
we can deal with nascent technology and how permissionless innovation is
not only good for people but also good for the market. The problem of
course is that, you know, we're running internet technology technologies
straight into financial regulations which are the most draconian and
most rigorous of regulations. The two don't quite meet. So you are also
meeting a problem of translation, with policy goals that are now trying
to be adapted to this decentralized world and the analogies do not bare.
So we need an entirely new conversation about what the goals are of
these rules and how we can build the right rules rather than complying
with existing broken rules. Law moves very slowly ,as Christian
mentioned. It's based on analogy and precedent. Transformative
technology challenges lawmakers and lawyers to make that active
translation. On the regulatory front, there's a misalignment of
incentives. You have one federal agency focused on security of finance,
and then others that are evaluating firms for soundness, and then
another one about horizontal access to the developing world. Everyone
has their own specific mandate and a limited idea about the technology.
As public policy concerns are being brought up, it's a challenge for
lawmakers. So what would I do with a blank slate? The problem with these
exponentially transformative technologies is that it exacerbates the
governance gap. So we have to, because these issues are complex and
multi-disciplinary, you can't have one regulator talking to a
technologist and expect the right policies will emerge. I think on one
hand we need to build our products and services in such a way to provide
security and to provide sound products to consumers and address the
usability issues. On the other end, we need to steer that conversation
as both Jerry and Elizabeth have mentioned, we need a collaborative
rulemaking process rather than one agency coming out with a proposal,
the community reacting, and a conversation based on old paradigms and
issues.

Christian: If I was to summarize all three of you, it sounds like safe
harbor is key here. The internet analogy is useful, but we need to not
forget that getting safe harbor right or wrong could determine the
policy. So it is about policy. If it is too narrow, then the safe harbor
is useless. If it is too broad, then we run into market failure issues
or damages to consumer confidence. So how could you envision a better
process where you have policymakers on one side, and developers, hackers
and platforms on the other side trying to come up with new technological
solutions? Yes we can envision the fruits of this wonderful technology,
but there's years of development on the way, for smart contracts,
intellectual property.

Constance: I think that is a problem we all identify. Technologists are
building. The regulators know what the concerns are but they have no
idea what the capabilities are. So the two must meet. So what we've done
is we put a multi-disciplinary workshop at MIT and Harvard this January
and we had a group of technologists, subject matter experts across four
days distilling what the state of the technology is, talking about the
regulatory concerns and mapping the goals of these rules to these means.
And so we have working papers now across various subject matters like
smart contracts, DAOs, oversight for decentralized networks ((what?)).
This is also at Stanford at the end of March. We are bringing in
policymakers, lawyers, legal experts, privacy experts, cryptographers so
that we can substantiate what the technology is capable of now and
perhaps the policy goalposts have moved.

Jerry: I think there's a two-pronged approach. I think we need
processes. We need to articulate exactly what we envision as an
alternative to regulation. But at the same time, we have to recognize
that regulators are people who have incentives that they are responding
to. Those incentives are things like a statute that they are required to
enforce. They are reading the statute, they may not think it applies,
but their job is to enforce. So we have to be ready with these ideas to,
in short terms, thinking, you have to figure out how to get it as good
as you can get it. I think ultimately there are some laws some
regulations that are impossible to comply with if you use.. using this
technology. I think this is going to bring some conversations to a head.
I think those will come soon enough. If you are talking about money
transmission, AML (anti-money laundering), yes I am slipping into
jargon. You do have to be reactive sometimes. I think you try to
anticipate, but sometimes it is waiting to see what the regulators want
to do. Hopefully you have tried to shape their thinking about it, that
they have the right information so they are not misinformed about what
they are regulating.

Elizabeth: I am concerned right now. California just this last week
released a law saying that no virtual currency company can operate in
the state without a license or an exemption for banks or a big
corporation. New York has released a proposal that would stifle
innovation in its state and beyond. Regulation is the biggest threat to
the Bitcoin ecosystem. Part of why I am so concerned, this community,
and there are some people that don't want regulation.. People need to
band together, and they need to say we can do things better. For
example, the recent Bitstamp hack I am sure people have heard about. It
is inexcusable that Bitstamp wasn't using multisig. We can do better as
a community. We can implement this. We can show policymakers and
regulators that we can be more secure and more efficient. That is our
job right now. I invite the community to engage and get involved. Tell
policymakers and regulators that we can do better, and that the laws
they are proposing will not work for our space. There is an argument
that maybe some investors will invest, but much of the VC funding is
here in this country. The internet is global. Australia and the UK are
far more friendly and open minded to Bitcoin. They want to compete on
this level. People will leave. Entrepreneurs are leaving this country to
go elsewhere.

Christian: Yes, regulation can stifle innovation. How do we get the
problems that the regulators have to comply with, because of old laws?
Or there is still an issue that they have to pursue? How do we get those
problems into those communities?

Jerry: Multisig, and proof of solvency, are already working. How do you
convince regulators? I think it is hard to show up and talk to them
about a futuristic vision about replacing regulation (there job) with an
algorithm. I think you need to just do it. Just build it. I think that's
what we're seeing. And then it's a matter of.. trying to get rid of that
vestige.

Constance: I do think that it is also a problem of, the ecosystem is
small and we are dealing with powerful incumbents. There is so much
innovation in Bitcoin that there needs to be more coordination and
collaboration. If this fulfills a slightest fraction of the potential
that we all suspect, there's more than enough market share for everyone.
If we can raise the common floor of practices in this space, if we can
prevent these badly executed hacks, implement best practices like
multisig or proof of reserves, these would stop bad news stories that is
feeding into a very misleading news narrative about what Bitcoin is. We
should collaborate and share practices. It is incredibly powerful to the
regulators when the ecosystem does act like adults. When you look at
when MtGox went down, and the leading exchanges and wallets in this
space,

((feed cutoff at 2h 46m 34s))

Constance: it is powerful to the regulators when .. I remember when I
was young, I overheard that 10% of the role earned 90% of the wealth.
That was inconceivable to me. So now you are seeing an acceleration of
that inequality, which I think is systematic. I think the financial
rails have contributed to that. One of the exciting things about the
blockchain is the ability to have an immutable incorruptible data trail
((this is not entirely true though?)). Many people think that GDP is the
cake and everything else is the icing. The truth is that the GDP is the
icing. The actual value creation is what counts. What would be very
interesting and what I would like to see is people creating value
systems that count the actual value creation. That would be an
interesting exercise.

Elizabeth: It gives us a chance to start over. This is why this
discussion is so important.

Q: There's different kinds of regulation. It's not so black and white.
Look at for instance healthcare. Regulation, traditionally was primarily
at the edge through licensed professionals. Accountants the same way.
Lawyers too. It was only recently that regulation has focused on more on
the central, the hospital, the vendor, the FDA. Where could that kind of
to the extent that Bitcoin is a distributed environment could there be
an intermediate regulation where there is a professional licensed as a
profession rather than capital intensive infrastructure?

Jerry: So, you know, regulators are always going to try to find the
choke point that is easiest place with the least amount of effort to get
what they want done. That is going to be an intermediary. So Bobby,
sorry, Charlie Lee was talking earlier about online gambling and how the
way gambling is regulated is through payment processors because there's
four or five payment processors you can go to and say don't allow
gambling. If you have a decentralized system like Bitcoin and everyone
has their own bank, it becomes difficult. It's not impossible, but it's
much more costly to regulate those endpoints. We see new intermediaries.

Hopefully we can get around market failures and ... a perfect market I
know we heard one, I know that economists believe that market failure
reasons exist, I think we have enough talent in this room to tackle
those challenges thank you very much.
