We would like to start with a brief activity. In you rprograms, this
says design workshop. If that scares you, then we will not be doing
trust falls. We will not be forming teams. But we would like to start
with an activity. Identify someone around you who you do not know. Keep
a mental image of that person in your mind.

Would you trust this person to save your seat? Would you trust them to
watch your laptop if you went to get lunch? Would you loan them $15 to
grab lunch? In cash? Would you give them your credit card to swipe?
Would you trust them to repair the elevator in this building? Would you
trust them to keep your deepest darkest secret? Would you trust them
with your private key?

yes, no, yes, yes, no, yes, yes, only already insecure private keys

Trust is important. My name is Matt. This is Joe. We are designers at
Ideo. We love deep human constructs that are both rational and emotional
like trust. We can say whatever we want about trust.

oh...
