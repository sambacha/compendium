What are the lessons from the development of the internet that we can
learn from? Why is there an inevitability as to what Bitcoin is doing?

At a high level, I like to explain that we are experiencing a
fundamental transformation in how the world economy stores and verifies
value. Bitcoin and these other projects that are being built are part of
that arc. We have talked not just about payments. It's about how
ownership and fidicuiary trust in general can be managed. And
development of standards of how entities interact in this digitzed world
of fidicuiary trust.

The impact of this technology disruption and derivative work and work on
Bitcoin itself will have a huge impact not just on finance. We focus a
lot on finance. But also a huge impact on accounting, commercial law,
civil law, property rights, insurance, and any intermediary industry
built on the basis of disconnected ledgers. And human processes for
verifying analog information. All of these fidicuiary trust institutions
will be impacted.

The first use case that people have been focusing on is payments. I
think there are others. I think we are in a similar place. This is an
analogy that lots and lots of people use. We are in kind of that birth
of the digital web phase of digital currency. We are seeing a similar
scale of venture capital and enthusiasm from early adopters. Nobody
knows what the big transformation will be.

What people may not remember is that in 1994 there were like 4,000
websites. It was completely insecure. The standards were immature. Using
HTTP and HTML were really a joke. You could do almost nothing with them.
There was a deep amount of skepticism from entrenched government,
private and commercial interests. We will come back to that both
historically but also the skepticism we see today around Bitcoin.

Bitcoin today is not useful for an average person. It is confusing. It
is complicated. It is enormously challenging to use today. The web in
1994 you could do little with. We saw that we could do more if we
improve the architecture.

What happened over the next 20 years we kind of know, we had the
wholesle transformation in commerce and media built on open protocols.
That work that it took, the technical work and the associated capital
investments in software and improving protocols and capital expenses
took many years to unfold. The $500 million in venture capital for
Bitcoin should become billions of dollars of associated infrastructure.
That might take 5 years until we start to see a single digit impact on
the financial system. Online commerce is only 5% of retail sales today.
TV is 96% of viewing hours even though it feels like youtube has had a
huge impact.

What is it about the technologies and protocols that enabled these
transformations? How can we learn from that with what is happening with
Bitcoin?

I think the internet itself has encoded into its architecture a set of
ideals. These ideals are what makes so many of things that we take for
granted, work. The internet id distributed and decentralized originally
conceived by the Defense Department, so that there was no single point
of failure. That distributed architecture allows for scaling. Anyone can
join. The internet has no.. there is no company that can say no. If you
have a piece of software that speaks IP, you can get on the internet.
You don't have to ask permission. That is deeply democritizing.

This is always surprising to people when I say this. Nobody runs hte
internet. Young people find that hard to believe. Older people don't
understand that the internet is not governed by a company or any
corporation or any specific government. It's a consensus-based
environment that evolves with technical standards and protocols.

There are nuances to this. Simplistically speaking, it is not governed
by anyone. A payment system not governed by anyone is also hard for
people to understand. Modern society runs on infrastructure that nobody
controls (the internet). So they are able to get their heads around
this.

Fundamentally this architecture happens because there are public
specifications, informal and formal standards bodies, there are open
source projects where there is this enormous public good that everyone
can take advantage of. These are really core ideas, if we didn't have
open source we would not have the internet that we know of today.

All of these ideals play themselves out. There are companies behind some
of the efforts. It's not koombiyah free culture driving everything.
There are companies at the foundation of what gives Bitcoin to be the
opportunity to be the HTTP of value transfer.
