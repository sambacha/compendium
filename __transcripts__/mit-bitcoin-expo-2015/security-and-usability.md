Security and usability.

Elizabeth: I think this is a highly relevant discussion. I talked a bit
about regulation. Regulation might be the number threat, but security
might be the number two threat. I am excited to have a panel of leaders
in this space who are actively building in this ecosystem. I am going to
ask each to do a quick intro.

Alan: I am the original creator of Armory and the Armory Bitcoin wallet.
Last year I gave an introduction to Bitcoin. We have been around
since 2011. I started to acquire Bitcoin from mining. Now we are
developing enterprise solutions on the topic of security and usability
they would say that Armory does not have usability at top of mind.
Others have that in mind. Our focus is security though. That's where
we're going with large institutions who have the resources to get over
the usability and do the security right.

Melanie: I got into Bitcoin in 2011. I was doing a PhD sponsored by
Microsoft at the time. I became utterly fascinated by it. I spent the
next couple years figuring out how to do something meaningful in this
space. Biometrically secure will be launching in a couple weeks.

Kristov: I started writing a book about Bitcoin privacy. That is a topic
that I care about quite a bit.

Elizabeth: What do you see as the biggest pro and biggest con in terms
of Bitcoin security?

Melanie: I think one of the biggest limitations is the users themselves.
I think that placing responsibility in the hand of users is often times
there is human error. Losing a piece of paper and private keys.

((feed just skipped forward by like an hour))

Alan: Sometimes the community mischaracterizes the security as one size
fits all.

Kristov: There will be different needs that people have for Bitcoin. But
I am not sure that I agree that we are necessarily going to see people
being their own banks, and then we will gravitate back towards something
in between. I think that what we will see is closer to the realm of
being your own bank in the Bitcoin space because in terms of engineering
we can accomplish this, we can allow grandma to be her own bank without
a substantial risk of funds. I think there are some things that we need
to develop to get there. There is a temptation to say, man, hey, ...
achievable..

Elizabeth: I gave my grandfather a bitcoin for christmas a few years
ago. It is currently being held in a hosted wallet. So I want to
know.... where will he be his own bank?

((lots of streaming problems))

Melanie: To get people to actually .... using Bitcoin.. you are
competing with credit cards. It's fairly simple to use a credit card. We
should all be developing products that... to use ...

Melanie: So that you can be a little bit careless. You're not completely
at risk if you lose that credit card. With Bitcoin, obviously we all
know that... that's not the case.. so you have to change that perception
and that behavior... and getting people.... You do need to own your own
security. You do need to be more aggressive about that.

Kristov: So I think the world in which ... where we adjust from a very
old world perspective to the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. A lot
of the challenges that come around security come from the fact that
Bitcoin is so ... When you put it in the realm of money, people care a
lot more. NSA downloading your photos from Facebook, meh. When you have
bad Bitcoin privacy, people take all of your money and they hunt you
down. So putting things in the realm of money is going to change things
quite a bit in a way that we are not going to expect.

Elizabeth: A recent survey among Facebook users were unaware that they
were using the Internet. Usability is going to be a major issue. QR
codes or strings of alphanumeric.. or long random passwords.. are not
usable. Are usability and security fundamentally at odds with each
other? And if not how can we address that issue?

Melanie: As you become more secure and you add layers of authentication
and security.. it gets more challenging... it does not have to be that
way. There are great products that are secure and easy to use.

Elizabeth: Like what?

Melanie: I think that LaunchKey is an interesting product. What's ideal
security though?

Elizabeth: I think that LaunchKey is a device-based authentication
company. Kind of like authy?

Melanie: I think we need to define what ultimate security looks like.
And then what does the ultimate use case look like? That's where we
should looking for products. It's hard enough to enter into the Bitcoin
ecosystem to think about these things. It needs to be as few steps as
possible. It also needs to be the security of paramount importance for
that user.

Alan: My perspective is sort of contrary, but not specifically. I have
an enterprise focus at the moment. Focusing on large organizations with
employees managing money. It would be hard to say Bitcoin is going to be
mainstream but we wont have large banks handling money? The difference
between the consumer and the institution is that the consumer is
managing their own money. They wont steal from themselves, it's already
their money. But when you have employees managing, it's a different
story. You just can't do that or don't make sense in the consumer space.
My focus is on enabling those larger organizations which is the
narration that I am going with. Those organizations have to have a high
security solution that is not going to be usable by consumers, but they
can also train employees and implement strong processes.

Melanie: I think that the way that security will look for consumers and
institutions will be different. People have time to be trained.

Kristov: What we aim for is not perfect security but a certain
threshold, which is context-dependent. I think there is a trade-off has
been reached in other industries, like automobiles. There's some
tradeoff with a car that is fun to drive and a car that is safe. A car
with no doors and no roof, you can do all kinds of exciting things with
cars if you have no safety standards. I think we will figure this out
with Bitcoin.

Elizabeth: Does centralization of say consumer funds pose a threat to
the ecosystem when it comes to security? We have seen hacking, like
against Bitstamp.

Alan: My opinion is that, that whole infrastructure around centralized
Bitcoin storage solution is not mature. We know about cold storage and
multisig, and one of the things I talk about is in the institutional
security world.. having employees manage valuables is not new. They have
processes around that involve people, witnesses, lawyers, notaries. They
have existed, they just haven't got into the Bitcoin system yet. There's
this kind of.. it's going to be there. It just hasn't been there. So
drawing too many conclusions based on the current state does not
necessarily mean it wont be there. The maturity level and the
institutions and so on, it just hasn't lead to that being integrated
properly yet.

Kristov: Yeah the pattern is, let's start a Bitcoin company, okay well
we're going to make a copy of how it worked in the last financial
system, we will have a lot of controls removed because it's Bitcoin and
new, and that's a lousy place to start off. Naturally that's where they
started. If we can get everyone, especially the leaders to adopt the
cutting edge technological things, we would be a lot better off, like
multisig and proof of reserves, voting, threshold signatures, if we
could people more uniformly applying this across the board we would see
less theft.

Elizabeth: What role does education play in engaging both the enterprise
and consumer side of things?

Melanie: I think education plays a huge role. The kind of education is
in the hands of the media, and they don't do a good job of understanding
Bitcoin. I think a huge challenge is how we as a community face towards
that audience. I think we are getting better at that. I think the
conversation is becoming a little bit more positive, except when we have
price volatility. I think that's where the education has to start.
People have to start speaking out about the benefits and why we need
Bitcoin security. And once you have a positive conversation sand then
you can educate consumers about what it is actually like to use Bitcoin.

Kristov: I have a few thoughts about education. It's a stop-gap measure
for designing security into systems. If we can educate users to be more
proactive about protecting themselves, then we don't have to build the
security into it. We should just build it into it, it should be
intuitive and natural. Education is not a replacement of that. We can't
get everyone to the point of being an undergrad MIT computer science
student. So in the Bitcoin space, I think this is a good place to be, a
lot of the progress that is made is driven by consumer demands and not
by industry standards or government demands. For this progress to be
made, this has to be driven by educated consumers. A lot of what I run
into is a lot of Bitcoin consumers are not informed about the privacy
aspect of Bitcoin. They know a little about security, much less about
privacy. We are not seeing a lot of demand for privacy-friendly
services. So we need to educate users about how it is important and it
is going to impact you and you should be asking for privacy from these
companies. I think this will create better services.

Elizabeth: What benefit can blockchains provide for security beyond just
money itself? We have talked about the future of this space. What do you
see in the future?

Kristov: So, I think that Bitcoin is actually in terms of pushing the
boundaries on security, I think it's kind of moving in several
directions at once. In the cryptography side of things, we are ahead of
the curve. We are seeing people splitting up keys, using cold storage
instead of hot wallets, using multisig. That's more advanced than what
banks are doing. There's a very low percentage of banks that are doing
things like splitting up cryptography keys so that attackers have to
compromise multiple sites; they don't do that. On the front of
application consumer, like network application security stuff that
happens everywhere on the web, we're behind because we're a new
industry, but I think we will catch up pretty quickly. I think that
Bitcoin is already ahead, 10 years from now it will be staggering as to
how far ahead Bitcoin is for securing funds and banks are not going to
be able to catch up without joining up with Bitcoin.

Alan: I think that at its core, multisig is something totally new to the
world of physical security... This idea that you can have something
protected by private keys that are all generated independently in their
own environments, they are never brought together, you can independently
generate them, the people managing the devices don't have to know who
the other people are, they don't have to know the security of the other
locations. You can create a truly truly decentralized security system
and no point was ever a single point of failure. I toured the Verisign
facilities where they have a 6000 pound safe that holds tons of
cryptographic material. And they have 17 people to get into that safe.
That cryptographic material was generated in one place, sure, and
there's a huge process, but maybe you can scale this back now that you
have 7 independent locations and there was never any colocation from
start to end, you have a fully distributed security model.

Melanie: Well, one, multisig. Healthcare, banking, finance, I think
everyone will see what's going on in our space and modeling their
security off of what we have been doing for years.

Elizabeth: There are still browser vulnerabilities. Mainstream users do
not like browser extensions. What about hardware approaches to ensure
security?

Melanie: It's a multisig hardware wallet, one of the keys is in a
database on the server, one of the keys is on the device, one is in
third party cold storage that you can manage. We generate one of the
keys on the device, so that we can maintain the RNG and know which keys
you generate. The key in cold storage is third party, and if you want
access to it that's great, but I think for the mainstream user that key
and protecting it themselves I don't think that sits well for me, so for
mainstream users that will not work out. Each one of our private keys is
secured by a different layer of authentication, biometric inherence
factor protects the key in the database, and the information layer
protects the key in cold storage.

Kristov: One of the challenges around hardware wallets, we need trusted
competing devices. In the consumer space, we see a condensing to one
device. We used to have a camera, mp3 camera, now we have one device and
they are all getting smaller unless you are an iPhone user of course.
Hardware wallets do not need to be these huge beefy machines. Maybe it's
just a chip on the phone, maybe it's something embedded in your body,
it's not something that will weigh you down. But right now, the smallest
device that I have heard of, outside of Ledger, there's trezor and these
other things that is like really big and you have to carry it around.
That's a burden for the average user.

Melanie: One of the things we're doing and putting money into is, right,
I think money is moving towards a single phone that we all want. When
that phone has everything about you, like healthcare, money, that's...

Elizabeth: What happens if you lose your phone or it's stolen?

Melanie: I think hardware plays a huge role in this ecosystem. In two
years, I have no idea what role it will play.

Alan: On the enterprise side, things are not necessarily getting
smaller. These are concepts that have been around for 20 years to
protect other types of cryptographic material. This is known as HSM.
These are $5k-$30k Linux boxes that you put into a rack, it destroys
itself when you try to break into it, it's what the biggest banks in the
world use, it's what the rootzone DNSSEC security that protects the
backbone of the internet uses. Only recently there are a few working on
some. Armory has announced integration with HSMs. Again it goes back to
the maturity of it. As large institutions get into it, like insurance
banks, they are already familiar with it. Banks and insurance companies
are already familiar with HSMs. That's a prereq for declaring that you
have a secure solution. This should be a requirement from the start.

Elizabeth: Recently we saw BitGo release a standard for security. Do we
need to establish a set of practices amongst the community?

Melanie: We use the matrix they came up with with C4.. My engineers all
have it on their desk ((if you actually read it though, it's... not
good)).

Kristov: Coming to consensus about this is critical. I am working on my
own project in the privacy space, we are working on publishing standards
in the privacy space as well. It's basic stuff that we have been doing
in security and infosec for a long time.

Melanie: It should not be the wild west.

Alan: It is going to converge. What you are going to see is that as more
institutions get involved, especially in the enterprise market, you see
a lot of overlap in the way these things are managed. What's trusted
ends up being the standard. You see all these companies that you believe
are secure, what are they doing similarly? That is going to become the
standard. The transparency of it and the standardization. New players
that come in will have a chance to know what to do to get insurance
quicker, and the insurance company will trust me more because of the
vetting.

Melanie: Companies should not have to make this up on their own. BitGo
and C4 are two different entities. I think that the community itself
should work together to have best practices. We need more of that.

Elizabeth: What about backdoors? Some people on the international level
are taking this seriously. I am going to assume that the panel is
against this. What can we do about backdoors?

Melanie: I was interviewing someone who worked at the NSA. I asked him
what he worked on. He was working on consumer firmware. It was a real
problem, we didn't hire him ((why not? he was experienced...)) We are
manufacturing, we have a device that we are shipping out. We are using a
New York state manufacturing company, it's 5 miles down the road from my
office. We are there when the devices are being manufactured. We want to
be intimate with the process. Having internal... having operational
security within your organization is important. We need standards for
that as well.

Kristov: I work for Blockchain.info, and one of their philosophies is
that you design the software so that when someone comes knocking, it
needs to be too late to do that. That boat had already sailed several
years ago. I encourage companies to do that as much as possible, not
because there's a particular organization that they are concerned about,
but rather because if you can give access to one organization then
others can take it from you as well. We need to build these systems as
secure and private as possible from the ground up, otherwise there is a
countdown on your business or organization where the compromise happens
and people will be really disappointed in you.

Alan: Operationally transparent is the right word I think. At the end of
the day listening to someone like Joi Ito talking about FMTs and
wondering about whether there is any end to the paranoia.. well, much of
it is justified. At the end of the day, the problem is split into many
pieces, and you need strong process at each of those steps. At the end
of the day you cannot prevent everything, but you can reduce it and pick
out large parts of the problem and know that some things have been done
right. And perhaps there are forces beyond our control. You cannot throw
up your hand and say it's unsolvable, you must solve this.

Q: We hear about stolen accounts in the world. Millions of stolen
accounts. I know lots of people around me that are probably among those
stolen accounts. But I have never heard anyone complaining that any
money was stolen from his account particularly. That's the first thing.
Can Bitcoin be stolen in the first place? At all? And by the way, if I
can buy coffee with my Bitcoin, that's not security that's limitation.

Alan: Can Bitcoin be stolen at all? I think that's a question of again
something that Joi Ito said. The cryptography is sound and it is really
the process around it that is insecure it. So maybe it's a philosophical
question to say, well they weren't really stolen, but... the fact is
that, the world depends on the actual programs and algorithms and the
cryptography behind it. When we talk about stealing coins, it will be
the human element not necessarily... it may be that you had humans in
the loop making bad decisions about which technology.
