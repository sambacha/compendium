He is the director of the MIT Media Lab. He served as the chairman of
the Creative Commons and is on the board of the Mozilla Foundation.

Just so that I can get a sense of the room, how many people here would
say that you are technical? Most of you. How many of you were on the
cypherpunks mailing list? How many of you have been threatened by
Timothy May? How many of you know Timothy May? Okay.

It's interesting. If you go back, this isn't really a new thing. I have
been paying attention, I was paying a lot more attention in the 90s. We
setup one of the first ecast servers. I hanged out with the cypherpunks
at the hacking conferences. I have been interested in this space for a
while. What's interesting is if you think about the arc of attention and
the sudden increased attention in cryptocurrency. I am looking at other
types of technology and platforms and how they proliferated in those
curves. I will talk about the community.

I don't know how many of you have read this, this went out on the
developers list. The research perspectives and perspectives for
challenges on cryptocurrencies. I am sort of influenced by this at the
moment. A lot of the stuff you already know, it sort of systematically
and neutrally goes around all the various types of attacks and
weaknesses and strengths. We need to bring in the non-, how do you call
it, the traditional computer scientists to look at this in a robust way.
In addition to all the regulators, there are a lot of people that aren't
sure how safe this is.

As we start to look at the security and think about formal proofs, I
guess it was Kevin Mitnick. The human in the loop is the weakest part of
the loop. You can have a secure algorithm that you can provably secure
but it is only as weak as the weakest part. Obviously human beings. And
also hardware. So I find it fun and ironic that Zappo has to put your
Bitcoin into deep freeze with the power off to make sure it is secure.
So we end up in the physical world.

And then you have to watch it through the manufacturing process because
of the possibility of tampering. I think that is one of the weakest
links. We have been working in Shenhzen lately at PCB factories, and I
am standing on that floor and there's people you trust, and working with
them is an essential element of that. We need to make sure that we don't
forget, I used to run an ISP and lots of people talked about cyberspace
as if there was no physical element. But there are really routers and
stuff sitting around. There's intermediaries.

The physical hardware is really quite exposed. In addition to thinking
about ,ti's not the bitcoiner's job, but we are putting more targetable
risk into the hardware devices that we have right now. I think that
thinking about secure hardware and network security is important. We
have to think about secure people. Do you trust the person on the
factory floor? Do you trust the person carrying it across the border?

The human brain is pretty hackable. It is more insecure than any
software system we have. This guy has an experiment where he wires up
your brain, and you click this button. Click and a light goes on, and if
the light goes on already, then you don't have to click it. Three
seconds after they see you getting ready to make the decision, they turn
the light on and you click it anyway because you don't realize the light
is on. And so there's a five second window in your brain after you have
decided to do something, before you realized you decided to do
something, I think that is a big security hole. Because he is sitting
there behind you, knowing before you know what you are going to do. And
what happens when you trigger that free will neuron? And we're learning
more and more about how we are going to be manipulating brains. We have
a great deal of self-deception. You may feel trustworthy, but somebody
may embed an exploit, like through hypnosis or something. I may have
many friends that I completely trust, but I wouldn't trust that their
brains haven't been tampered with.

Last week we did a gut biome discussion. Much of our personality is
driven by the bacteria in our gut. In certain diseases, a fecal matter
transplant (basically a poop transplant) fixes diseases but you also get
the personality and the allergies that you get the FMT from. So if you
could imagine stealth FMTs, and you wake up and suddenly you are a
different person. So we are going to need tamper-proof assholes. So we
know experimentally that you can copy personality from one person to
another with a fecal matter transplant, but what's interesting is when
the NSA begins to design bacteria to make you behave in different ways.
Perhaps this can solve depression in a few ways; so that means it will
be funded. You have to be aware of the different levels and layers where
attacks can occur.

There's a, there's another part which is when you think about the
hardware, it's really important to remember that, this could all be a
simulation. We could all be sitting inside a big AI, and then any
security we think we have is just an illusion. I don't know if you guys
know Bunnie Huang, but he had this idea, this Chinese GSM chip sitting
on a board built into his laptop. The chip had all of its pins wired up.
So for all the chip knew, it was being a phone. But it was on a little
card in his computer where he could manipulate any input or output. But
he was completely monitoring it and creating a simulation. All of our
hardware has concentric rings of vulnerability. For that chip he was
reverse engineering it. We should think about these shells. Regulation
has a lot to do with what we can and can't do with Bitcoin.

One thing to think about is the community and the architecture of the
community. If you think about the technology we use today, like
ethernet, it was probably not the best thing that could have been
devised at the time. Because of a variety of factors, it got to the
right place at the right time. You can use game theory in retrospect to
explain why ipv6 is not switched on everywhere. But in advance it would
have been hard to predict TCP/IP and ethernet. Those are probably more
to do with community architecture and personality than with technology.

Bitcoin wants to be widely accepted and scale in terms of impact and
proliferation. It is not necessarily the only success case. Take the tor
network for instance. It is extremely important and valuable for a small
subset of people. That could be a possible endgame for the blockchain.
It could be a small isolated community of people. I don't think that's
what most people think here. They want it to scale. So when you think
about scaling, you should look at the different things that have scaled
and why they were able to scale.

I was at a conference recently with Tim Berners-Lee. He got a question
he always get. Why did you get it all away? Why not try to make money on
the web standards? And we all kind of know the answer, but he said it
eloquently: well, it wouldn't have become the standard if I had patented
it and tried to make money. I put all the slashes there because that's
how people worked with filesystems, and tags were for SGML and the
markup community, but I was trying to design a standard that was most
likely to be adopted, by not encumbering it with intellectual property,
and trying to give it away. And the other part is that you had Tim. And
on the internet you had John Pascal(?) with initial names and numbers.
And you had Linus Torvalds that drew a line around the kernel and said
what's in and out. Most of these communities have ways of making
decisions and having core values.

I think one of the things that is tricky is you either have a
personality or it evolves over time. Pieces of the internet after John
passed away, ICANN does not work perfectly but it sort of functions and
it somehow allows the commercial and government interests... when I was
on the board of ICANN, the governments are only advisors. They have an
advisory committee. The government does not control ICANN. Nobody
controls it. It's consensus (what?). It's able to protect the technical
people from the financial interests. Engineering reasons win out.

I think this is important, and I may be biased, but there are tremendous
number of people who are highly technical but not motivated by money or
government at all. The internet is not run by the government. A big
chunk of the root nodes are crazy people that you have never heard
about, because they are bale to attract technical talent that want to
work on the right thing.

I think that what's interesting is that as financial interests get
involved in regulation, commerce, funding, it starts to skew the
interests of people from doing it because it's right or correct, to
doing it for other reasons. In places where the money has come in
quickly and the technical people have run away, you see huge failures.
Or in the worst cases where there wasn't any technical people in the
first place. I think the government on the internet realized that it
can't control it. It needs to depend on these non-commercial hippies at
some level. They are okay with this idea at some level. They are not in
charge. It took a lot of wrangling. I think technical people
underestimate how important it is to cut deals with corporations and
governments.

The web and the internet was similar. Remember the bubble just
before 2000. Late 90s. It was a mess. It was technically turning into
crap. You had big companies. AOL merging with Time Warner. It was
turning into a big pile of whatever. And it is interesting that after
the crash, Douglas Roschoff said the stock price to before the internet
existed. The market just said it's worth nothing, basically. Douglas
called this the internet fending off an attack by the venture
capitalists. Because that's kind of interesting. An attack. That's how
we think about network robustness. I think that's how we should think
about protecting this community and shepherding to technical things and
getting technical things right.

Right after the crash, you had blogs. Most blog software was written by
people who were recently unemployed. They wanted to say stuff, so they
wrote code. You had healthy stuff emerge after the crash because you
didn't have money people to accelerate stuff. I am a venture capitalist
and I invest, so I am not against business. There's a timing that is
very important. As a startup, you should not take money if you don't
know the direction. It's not a good thing. I distinctly remember there
was a thing called the web two point oh summit that Tim O'Reilly used to
run. It was trying to get people together after the bubble crashed and
to talk about it. It was a cool conference. I can't remember which one.

The fourth or fifth one, there were 2 sales people in front of me on an
elevator. They had just joined their companies. They were trying to sell
each other shit. I looked over and there was a trade floor of booths of
people trying to sell people stuff. Great, some of my favorite companies
exist, but my job is done here. I am going to move on. And they made
money from me. But there is a phase that goes through when you have
figured it out, then you hire the sales people and then they sell it to
each other. I think the tricky part about Bitcoin is that everything
happens at the same time. We're still trying to prove that the thing
even works.

I think the biggest risk right now is that the architecture of the
community is not... we don't even have Linus Torvalds. What do you call
in and out? I used to have these licenses at Creative Commons, anything
that looked like CC but wasn't one was bad because it was a fork. So
when you start to build the network you want to stamp out forks, but if
you are in the innovation phase you want forks. I think we're in one of
those periods where you can't tell whether forking is good and bad.
Because people are already using it while we are still in the
experimental phase. I think there's a tremendous amount of risk. We
should think about how this architecture gets created. How does the
community work?

This is more of a question. I don't think it's ICANN. I think there's
enough difference between internet and Bitcoin. There are many
differences. I think we need to think about how to think about it.

One of the things that I think is important, and which is why I like
amiller's paper, you need a substantial chunk of people that everyone
trusts to be involved not for commercial reasons but because you want to
make things work properly. You don't know if they are being exploited,
maybe they have conflicts of interest, maybe they work for the NSA,
maybe you can build this trust. There is so much blurring because of so
much venture capital money, it's hard to find a safe space.

I want to end by proposing that everyone joins #bitcoin-wizards on
freenode. I think academic institutions could help. I think this paper
was Stanford and Princeton and maybe another one. What we are going to
try to do is that MIT should also have a role to play here... I cannot
officially announce, that we are starting to, we don't have a name for
it yet, but we have a MIT cryptocurrency initiative, and .. we've had
pieces and others working on Bitcoin stuff. I've met with central
administration to go to Bitcoin a little bit broader. Simon Johnson who
is a good economist joined this initiative. Ron Rivest, a great
cryptographer, so what we are going to try to do is draw upon well known
neutral players who do not have a stake in Bitcoin to try to think about
the economics and the technical aspects of Bitcoin. I know about the
policy side, yes that's there too. I think at the beginning that the
academic institutions should serve as a place for people to hang out. We
will also be reaching out to other people. Brian/Bryan who just.. he was
at the whitehouse originally, but he wrote the internal whitehouse memo
on Bitcoin. Now he is the project manager to pull the resources together
at MIT. If you want to get involved, talk with him. To finish by cycling
back to the security discussion.

I do think that real security, not security for just our friends, but
from our friends and others when we talk about true trustless networks.
Well that requires hardware that we can really trust. I think that's
another area that we should start working on at MIT because we can sort
of justify saying we are going to try to research pure security without
making it sound like we're cypherpunks afraid of black helicopters.

So anyway, that is what we would like to do. Anybody who would like to
be more involved, I would like to coordinate. That's a new project that
we will be starting. Thanks everyone for coming.
