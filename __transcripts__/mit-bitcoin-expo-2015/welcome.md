We are going to get started in about two minutes, so please take your
seats. We are also testing the mic for the live stream. If you have
friends who are not here, feel free to tweet them, email them or post
their facebook page or instagram whatever.

Hey. All y'all ready? Alright, awesome. My name is Jing, I am president
of the Wossley Bitcoin Club.

Last year we had over 500 attendees and we had the launch of the MIT
Bitcoin project.

What's different this year? We have two days full of speakers. We are
trying to get more academic so that we can dive into the heart of
cryptocurrency. We have Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin. He leads
the product engineering team at Coinbase currently. Please join me in
welcoming Charlie Lee.
