Forked to Death: What Internet governance can learn from Bitcoin

So, the last talk today is going to be from Pindar Wong. He's been
involved with Internet in Hong Kong. He also helped organize the Scaling
Bitcoin workshops. It's my pleasure to have him speaking today.

Okay. Thank you very much for staying until the bitter end. My topic
today is forked to death, what Internet governance can learn from
Bitcoin. I do mean this, and I would like to explain why. This is a
fork. I am holding a fork.

In Internet governance, we don't talk about forks, we talk about
fragmentation. The title here should be fragmentation to death, what
Internet governance can learn from bitcoin. Fragmentation from the
internet is a real and present danger. This morning we heard we have an
internet one behind China and one behind the United States.... I am from
Hong Kong. We had some views this morning about the miners in China. As
you also know, I was honored to finally meet many of you through the
process of Scaling Bitcoin.

Bryan Bishop at the end of Phase 2, why not post to the -dev mailing
list about reflections about the event? Phase 1 was one of the times
when many developers got together. And phase 2 was when all of the hash
power got together for the first time. Looking back on that, this
presentation is looking back on those two recent events, as well as the
recent Satoshi Roundtable and also the Hong Kong meeting.

First I would like to thank the students from MIT who came up to
Montreal to help up with this seminal events. MIT DCI was one of the
core underwriters for this event. Jeremy Rubin was the chair for
phase 1. So thank you so much for that.

So what can Internet governance learn from Bitcoin? The first point is
that the Bitcoin community is very careful about attempts to externalize
cost. This is really smart. At Scaling Bitcoin, I was the most stupid
person in the room, which means I was in the right room. This group is
really sensitive to the notions of externalizing costs. BGP attacks were
mentioned earlier. Spam is another example. We did not do that cost
externalization analysis, and I think this community does that really
well, we should really learn from Bitcoin about when to externalize cost
in a shared system.

The second one is that it's about meritocracy, we don't care who you
are, it's rather about your ideas. We see past race, gender,
orientations, prejudices, it's a technical meritocracy for proof-of-work
of hard work. To see people get on planes and come to the event for
Scaling Bitcoin and have really deep civilized respectful technical
conversations, was wonderful to see.

The other thing that I have learned... I still use email. I don't use
chat. I have only tweeted maybe 40 times. This community has discovered
something faster than light, and that's rumor. It's real-time media
audit. The use of reddit and the use of IRC and all the different chats,
it seems 24 hours per day. That's something to recognize, because to me
that's something really different. Cory and I had an interesting
exchange, he said, would the internet have occurred if it was constantly
under the media spotlight that current internet provides? I think the
answer is no, but it's ust my hypothesis, we can't check this.

I think this community is develping an immune system. I don't think it's
about governance. Let me explain why. Let's look at the Internet today.
I started the first ISP in Hong Kong in 1993. That was 23 years ago? How
many of you are under 23? So technically, before you were born, geeze I
feel old. July 5th, 1993, there was a famous comic in the New Yorker,
which said that on the internet nobody knows you are a dog. That
resonated with me because the internet was the first time at a societal
level that mainstream can talk about the internet and say whatever it
wanted. This year we see mainstream talking about Bitcoin. So keep this
in mind.

The reality is that, right now, despite the Internet, what we have is
that people doing metadata analysis, doing data surveillance and making
accusations and allegations. The metadata these days is the message. We
have developed this Internet which was supposed to be free and open, and
in terms of previous governance, we have failed.

Also in terms of governance, before text, we had a wonderful word which
I am going to describe. It was before images. The people who were at the
cusp, like Joi Ito, who run the MIT Media Lab, who feel strongly about
Bitcoin so that we don't make technical compromises that jeopardize
interoperation of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Today I was supposed to be in Morocco for an ICANN meeting. The internet
kind of just works. Well, there's a lot of engineering that makes the
Internet work. The closest thing I could say for consensus protocols is
like BGP. All of the routers have this algorithm, and the packets end up
where they should. On the internet, you need a hierarchical numbering
system of IP addresses, like for IPv4. I was also the device chair of
the IP name assignment for the agency. This meeting is important, I
think, because it's the 55th meeting. Scaling Bitcoin has only had 2.
This has had 55 minutes since 1998. It's supposed to decide if the US
government lets go of the car keys, and lets ICANN self-administer. This
was supposed to happen on September 30th, 2000. So we are 16 years
later. Perhaps better late than never?

This is as close to Internet governance as you will probably get. You
all remember that in Bitcoin, on the front page of The Economist, was
"the trust machine". If you look at today's Economist, there was an
article about Internet governance. This topic is about Internet
governance and what it can learn from Bitcoin.

So what is Internet governance? It's blah blah blah blah. It took
several years to negotiate the text. "Internet governance is the
development and application by governments, the private sector and civil
society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules,
decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and
use the internet."

Guys like me show up in jeans, and then they ask who am I? The
difference is that engineers are willing to solve it no matter who the
engineers are, but then the Internet governance discussion becomes "who
are you?". I think that's the wrong model.

We heard this morning that you can escape government but you still need
governance. I think what we have right now with Bitcoin is actually
working, though. Governance is the wrong model. If you talk about
governance, you are talking about control, centralization, you're
talking about aligning different interests, whereas if we changed that
model, from this afternoon's presentation, if at any time after this
time forward and hear someone saying "Bitcoin governance" ask them to
stop and ask about health instead. It's about Bitcoin ecosystem health.

Anything that you do, should improve the Bitcoin ecosystem health,
however you perceive that to be. Don't talk about governance, talk about
ecosystem health. What I mean by Bitcoin health is that we are building
a healthy industry with all of the different players, including
academia. Everyone has different interests, but what aligns us all is
that we are an ecosystem of interdependent almost by design, and in so
doing, we need to think carefully about the health of the whole
ecosystem and your own individual.

Yes, we're dealing with issues of technical scalability, like the block
size discussion and debate, the drama that has happened over the past
year and a half, but sorry that's absolutely normal. Maybe it's your
first time going through the mill, but this is sort of the strength of
Bitcoin itself.

Beyond technically scalable, which is something that I think we can
solve, but is the whole thing economically sustainable? I think that's
an open question. The subsidy and the cost of operating the system, like
CPU time, like unspent transactions, and calculating the total cost of
the system so that the whole thing is economically sustainable in
addition to technically sustainable. For an ecosystem like this, what
would you consider to be pollution? What is normal? What is UTXO
pollution? What would you consider to be normal? What would you consider
to be a normal functioning Bitcoin ecosystem? That's the imagine that I
hope we can define.

In the Internet ecosystem, we talk about evolution. There are no
permanent favorites. In regards to the recent events in 2013, such as
the Snowden revolutions, and NIST compromised recommendations, and the
IETF engineering task-force has classified that as an attack. Previously
they recognized censorship as an attack that the Internet routes around,
that's an evolutionary process. We admit that we make mistakes, we learn
from it, and we evolve. In an ecosystem health model, also look at an
evolutionary health model, things that don't evolve will die. So we
think about balance and that kind of thing.

So that's the whole concept of stimulus and response, such as
stimulating your immune system, and having it adapt and evolve. This is
used in Japan for kaizen for continuous improvement. I believe Bitcoin
should have the best tech, the best people, evolving the system to meet
higher goals.

How many of you remember this? Yeah, the mosaic browser. Okay you are
all geeks. a16z before he was a VC, he actually wrote code, like Mosaic
(NCSA). This was around 1993. There was an era before that, which was a
magical era, which was the era of pure text, pure imagination, no
graphics, no distractions.

In that era, we had a timeline, we had the academic networks up to 1993
more or less, we had our trade association from 1991 for the commercial
Internet exchange, which my ISP joined as a member. This National
Science Foundation network was designed to survive nuclear attacks.
There was a whole bunch of 20 more years of research and development
that ended around 1993. The commercial guys, I dropped out of
university, I was 23 or 24 at the time, had a PhD, co-founded an ISP,
and obviously ISPs were commercial they had the goal of making money. So
you keep costs low, and you keep your revenue high. This was built into
our blood in Hong Kong.

There was a huge culture clash between those who were purists versus
those who are commercial. There were culture clashes there which we sort
of see now in Bitcoin, those who are interested in making money, and
then a bunch of Bitcoin Core developers who are flag bearers for Bitcoin
principles. At that point in time, for those who want to double check,
look at the reports at the time. There was lots of drama. Nothing
particularly new, when you have a difference of culture.

Right now where we are in Bitcoin, in some sense we have this backwards.
We have gone commercial, and as Arvind said is that academia is good at
scaling knowledge, but it's still warming up. Some of us are good at
building Internet, which I will talk about.

I think that the Bitcoin community is super sensitive to externalizing
cost. The ISP system was my community connects to your network. There
are 60 or 70,000 right now. There are 70,000 different autonomous
systems that comprise the Internet. When you are commercial, your goal
is to make money. So you either keep your costs low or you shift those
costs on someone else, you externalize your costs. If you keep your
costs low, and you shove the cost to the ecosystem, the environment lays
off you, you make more money, in commercial that's just the way it is.

I think the Bitcoin ecosystem is very clever in identifying where costs
are being externalized. That's really good in this stage of development.

Let's take a trip down the memory bus, and this is to highlight that
these big debates are perhaps nothing new. Get used to them. These won't
be the last. If you look at Rick Adams, who has a long history, he also
funded USENET, which was eventually acquired. In the old days of text,
there was a peer-to-peer network called USENET news. It had a technical
limitation. The USENET newsgroups could only have 14 character naming
limitations. That was the constraint. Some people wanted to have
newsgroups with more characters. There was a big revolt. They said
usually these original 7 groups, they were just chat boards, these
people who were interested in a certain subject would gather together
and talk about those 7 big categories. They were all based on
hierarchies.

And then there was a revolution, there was an "alt" hierarchy, pretty
much anything went. That's when I got introduced to the internet.
Looking at these USENET newsgroups, you had to go stitch things together
and it was very weird, you get really exposed to humanity at its rawest.
It was absolutely wonderful. It was absolutely diverse. You could find
anyone and everyone interested in one particular esoteric subject. At
the time, I was into.... and that's the internet I falled in love with
thing, it was borderless and nobody knew if you were a dog. It was all
text, no graphics.

Around that point of time, there was a book, someone wrote a book which
was a guide to this space, by Ed Kroi called Hitchhikers Guide to the
Internet (RFC 1118). Andreas' book is sort of like the first guide to
this space. And then there was the usenet wars. And then there was
another one, for the domain name system. This came from the US
government funded NSF network. The meeting today will hopefully decide
that it's time to end US government involvement.

The backbone network, there were about 4000 nodes in the network and
that's all they wanted. In 1992, when the government said this is
government-paid infrastructure, there were commercial players on the
line, a lot of people dropped out of school and joined companies
instead. Commercial was about making money, and the academic thinking
was entirely different and it was a culture clash.

Great coders like Marc Andreessen originally wrote Mosaic and Netscape
and the rest was history. The domain name system at the time was
something about translation from text strings to IP addresses... again
that had only 7 top-level nodes, was that a technical limitation, or was
that a historical accident? We have spent over 20 years trying to answer
that question through these 55 meetings.

At the time, registering a domain name was just $50. People started to
complain and they said it should be market priced. What's the fee
market? What's the market price of a domain name? Nobody knew. So we
took this "wait and see" attitude, and we have seen this price drop to
$5 or less, and now we have ICANN. I was involved when I was appointed
to.....

So from that perspective, if we look at how the Internet has not been
too graceful or strategic as the Bitcoin community, there are three
examples. BGP is one example, how networks exchange routing information
with one another. And yes you can attack it and redirect someone else's
traffic, but when you are an ISP, your basic cost is that you are
renting these communication lines. So if the traffic you receive off of
the network is not related to you, you get rid of it as soon as
possible, it's hot potato, you send it to someone else, you don't want
to incur that cost, so chunk it out a window as fast as possible.

Another example is email spam, sort of perhaps it is a design flaw in
the protocol. That's the way the protocol behaves, perhaps exploit it.
The very existence of email spam caused many people to run mail servers.
How many of you run mail servers? Huh weird all the Bitcoin Core
developers in the audience raised their hands.... and nobody else. Well
anyway.

Spammers can send millions of emails, and the rest of us have to bear
that cost, or we have centralization. This is an unintended consequence
of a design process in a protocol. It didn't forbid such behavior. So
the few spammers exploited that.

Are there equivalents for example with spam on Bitcoin able to inflate
the UTXO set? Sure. The transition that was supposed to happen between
IPv4 and IPv6.... Right? Which we just heard from IBM today. We are
facing not an Internet of things, but an Internet of threats.

Who knows what kind of software is in all these sensors? One of the
reasons I am here today instead of at ICANN, is because I think that
Bitcoin is building the foundation of trust. I don't actually know what
Bitcoin is. I think I know what it is. But it's going to evolve. In the
days of text, back in 1993, if someone said you are going to be doing
real livestreaming of video, I would have said what on earth are you
smoking because I want so.

There's a DNS root, which gets attacked every now and then. There's an
incident, like the Luke-Jr fork, the community responded within an hour,
because they all knew each other, they agreed to downgrade. There's an
Internet equivalent, which is when the DNS servers fell over. And then
we realized we needed a backup system, or rather that we had to keep the
initial servers working. So that community held everything together in
times of crisis.

Events like Scaling Bitcoin helps build the community equity. The best
quote I have from Scale 1 is "I'm an asshole, you're an asshole, let's
be an asshole together". That's great. The whole point being here is
that externalizing costs of a shared system, shared systems such as DNS.
If the protocol needs to evolve and your software if oyu are running
wallet software, sorry but you are going to have to write some code.
It's cheaper for me as a business to not absorb any costs of changing
any code, if I can just change a parameter that's great. But writing
wallet software for a fee market, sure that's a little complicated, then
I need to get that working. It's extra complexity. As a business you
don't want to do that, but then what's the cost to the ecosystem if that
player externalizes their cost to us?

I think this group, this brain trust, is quite amazing on answering that
question so far. So Internet governance is the wrong model. Bitcoin
governance, well just stop them right there, it's not about governance,
it's about ecosystem health. I think to have a productive discussion
about hwat your vision is of what that ecosystem looks like when it's
healthy. Furthermore, I think in recent discussions, by example of the
Internet, you end up healithier afterwards. Bitcoin Core has a very
clear website now, that's evolved. Stimulus and response.

So it's not really about governance, it's about health. And taking from
theory and putting things into practice. Some of the research is just
now happening, and we all want the best tech for Bitcoin.

What is the role of universities? We had NSFnet, we had
commercialization over 20 years. I was at FC 97, which was probably the
first one. So having interest in Bitcoin, universities really act as a
neutral platform. As you heard from Arvind, academia scales better.
Universities over a long time, serve as trust actors for society. As we
move from analog to digital, I think universities can serve as an early
warning device for societies.

Universities should run Bitcoin nodes on the network. They should
operate fully-validating nodes on the Bitcoin network. The MIT bitcoin
club should be running at least one fully-validating node. Could they
act as seed nodes for the rest of the network? Can you add telemetry on
this, to do research on Bitcoin?

It's also empowering students, like the MIT Bitcoin project, it's quite
helpful, like working on documentation or reading documentation and
thinking about the ethics of the ecosystem. If you found a fundamental
flaw in Bitcoin, as a researcher you could make money from that, right?
What would you do? What is the ethical thing to do? If you publish
yourself as a researcher, would you put yourself at personal risk
because it could be market moving? Why? Because currencies are a very
clear representation of societal trust and value.

So right now in terms of current participants in the network, this is
it, one in the BSafe.Network that I would like to announce, is the first
fully backwards-compatible network. There is MIT, Boston, UC Irvine,
University of Maryland, and in Erupe t's TU Darumshladt, University of
Cambridge UK, New Castle University UK, .... slide went away. I want to
stimulate discussion in blockchain research.

Do we need an NSFnet for Bitcoin? I say yes. We need to make this area a
safe space for legitimate serious research. We want the best minds. This
is an attempt to do that. There's a slight tweak in here, which is that
it should not be universities only, but also enthusiasts or outsiders
who should not be excluded from collaborating with the people who would
be otherwise operating on the "NSFnet" research project.

So with that, I will close and say that everything is going to be OK.
((applause))

See you tomorrow morning.
