We will be starting in 10 minutes. I would like to ask the first speaker
in the first session for grin to walk to the back of the room to get
your microphone ready for the talk.

It's 9 o'clock and time to get started. Could everyone please get to
their seats? Alright, let's do this. Welcome everybody. This is the
Stanford Blockchain Conference. This is the third time we're running
this conference. I'm looking forward to the program. Lots of technical
talks, and wonderful hallway conversations. I'm looking forward to
speaking with all of you and hearing all the talks.

There's a wifi network that you can connect to, either Stanford Visitor
or you can connect to the regular Stanford network. If you choose the
regular Stanford network, here's the username and password (Stanford and
sbc19/blockchain). There's livestream for tuning in at home, and the
hashtag is #sbc19.

The conference is hosted by the Center for Blockchain Research and
Stanford Cyber Initiative. With that, let's get started. The conference
is a way to introduce technical ideas into the blockchain research
community. The goals are to bring up new ideas and researc hchallenges.
Not marketing, new technical ideas. We want to bring together the
academic community with the actual projects in the trenches building
systems. Hopefully this will be a fruitful conversation for everyone,
and I'm looking forward to speaking with everyone.

This conference has been a lot of fun to run, and it's quite popular. We
have around 2000 people registered, and some of you were waitlisted as
well. Interest in the conference has been growing over the past few
years. Last year we had 400 attendees. This year we have 2000. Next
year, we're going to have 10,000 attendees if you extrapolate. So it's
pretty clear that next year this conference will take place at the
Stanford stadium. It will be interesting.

I would imagine more people would come in throughout the day. We have
more space at the other side of the conference center. Just head over to
the other side if you can't find any room. You can watch the talks from
over there. Since there's so many people coming, the only thing I would
ask is that if you are going to have a conversation, perhaps take it out
into the yard so that you don't disturb the actual speakers in the
lecture hall. Also, we will have session chairs to monitor and ask you
to speak outside instead.

Alright, very good. That's that. Putting a conference together takes a
huge amount of work. I want to thank all the organizers who did this.
The program chairs are myself and Benedikt Buenz. The general chairs are
Allison Berke and Byron Gibson. A round of applause to Allison and
Byron. Thank you, couldn't do this without you. It's been a lot of work
to put this together. They deserve your thanks.

In temrs of statistics for the program, we had about 120 submissions to
the conference. There were lots of wonderful talks that we wanted to
accept, but we only had space for 23 talks. There were really great
talks that we wanted to have, but there wasn't enough space. We ended up
accepting 23 talks which is an acceptance rate of 19% which is
respectable for a conference. I'm looking forward to these talks.

We had a volunteer group of the program committee members who did a
fantastic job of reviewing all the papers and writing comments. A round
of applause to the program committee, thank you for doing all of the
work. I think most of you are here, so thank you very much for all the
work.

The last set of people to thank are all of our sponsors. As you can see,
this conference is free. We want to keep this free, forever. A
conference for 2,000 people costs a lot of money to run. We couldn't do
this without the sponsors. We have a fair number of projects that
contribute to the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research, and to the
conference directly. We couldn't do this without the sponsors. Thank
you. If you would like to sponsor this conference next year, come see me
or Byron and help make this conference as successful as it can be, and
let's keep it free so everyone can attend without paying.

This campus is well maintained. Let me point out some tourist spots.
We're at the Arrilaga Alumni Center. I recommend going to the Rodin
Sculpture Garden and there's a good restaurant there. I recommend
walking across The Oval and enjoying the sculptures. There's Hoover
Tower open to the public but it's a bit of a longer walk. The whole
computer revolution happened within a 5 mile radius of this tower. If
you want to go further out, the Stanford Bookstore is a little further
out. There's lots of other things to see on campus but these are the
main attractions.

Stanford Center for Blockchain Research is for the community. Tell us
your hard problems, and we want to try to solve them. We have a monthly
seminar open to the public. If you go to the monthly seminar website,
there's a mailing list you can join. It's low volume. The only mailing
list emails that go out are about blockchain events on campus. Please
come to the seminar, and if you want to propose a talk, send me an email
and we can schedule that. Also, we have courses on blockchain. Check out
the CBR website. These are on-campus websites. All of our courses are
televized, and if you're interested in taking them, you can take them
from anywhere in the world and get Stanford credit. Also checkout the
Stanford Blockchain Club to see all the activities happening there. Lots
of activities on campus.
